cpolymer
========

Library to create polymer path with given functionnality, such as
some constrain on the position of any monomer.
It is also possible to create polymer with some rigidity

Here I show how to use the module to creato a block copolymer system:

Here How to create a polymer whose path has some specific constrain

Finally a little bit of fun with the creation of a polymeric eiffel tower
