cpolymer
========

Library to create polymer path with given functionnality, such as
some constrain on the position of any monomer.
It is also possible to create polymer with some rigidity

To install
=======

The easiest way:
sudo pip install cpolymer

Example of uses
=======

Here I show how to use the module to creato a block copolymer system:
